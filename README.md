# BB65 ZMK Config

## Instructions

1. You will need to [sign up for a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup), and [fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) so you can edit it.
2. Navigate to the **Actions** tab and click the "I understand my workflows, go ahead and run them" button to enable builds.

3. Edit the [config/bb65.conf](config/bb65.conf) to enable/disable features. Edit [config/bb65.keymap](config/bb65.keymap) to change the keymap. Lastly, make sure the [build.yaml](build.yaml) file has your board in the "boards" list.
4. After committing your changes, your firmware will begin compiling. Assuming there are no typos or other problems, it will eventually be [downloadable from the Actions tab](https://zmk.dev/docs/user-setup#installing-the-firmware).
5. [Flash the firmware](https://zmk.dev/docs/user-setup#flashing-uf2-files) that matches the board you're using, e.g. `bb65-nice_nano_v2-zmk.uf2` for a nice!nano v2.

## Common Questions/Problems

### There was an error and the build didn't finish.

#### There is probably an error in your keymap.

Carefully double-check the last changes you made. ZMK syntax is very different from QMK syntax. Note that when editing keymaps, each ZMK code is generally preceded by a reference categorizing what that code does.

For example: the letter "Z" is categorized as a **k**ey **p**ress. To add the letter "Z" to a keymap, it must be written `&kp Z`.

A few more examples below:

| QMK | ZMK |
| --- | --- |
| `KC_A` | `&kp A` |
| `QK_REBOOT` | `&sys_reset` |
| `LT(1, KC_SPACE)` | `&lt 1 SPACE` |

There are many, many more differences. Don't forget to [check the ZMK docs](https://zmk.dev/docs/features/keymaps).

### The RGB/encoder(s) don't work.

#### Double-check the features in the [config/bb65.conf](config/bb65.conf) file.

And double-check the Kconfig file in the build results to make sure what you've enabled is really enabled. As of mid-July 2022, [there are also some issues regarding default board/shield configurations taking precedence over user configurations](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/issues/1382).

### After disconnecting the keyboard from Bluetooth, it won't reconnect.

#### Forget the Bluetooth connection on both the BB65 and the host, then try re-pairing.

If you don't remember which profile on the BB65 was used to connect to a specific device, this may mean cycling through each (`&bt BT_PRV`/`&bt BT_NXT`) and clearing them (`&bt BT_CLR`) one by one. [See ZMK's documentation for more info](https://zmk.dev/docs/behaviors/bluetooth#bluetooth-pairing-and-profiles).

As a last resort, try flashing the `settings_reset` firmware for your board; this will force-clear everything.
